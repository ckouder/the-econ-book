Introduction
-------------------------

 - The study of the choices people make to attain their goals, given their scarce resources.

**economic model**
 - A simplified version of reality used to analyze real-world economic situation.

**goods**
 - Goods are tangible merchandise, such as books, computers, or Blu-ray players.

**market**
 - A group of buyers and sellers of a good or service and the institution or arrangement by which they come together to trade.

**scarcity**
 - A stituation in which unlimited wants exceed the limited resources available to fulfill those wants.

**marginal analysis**
 - Analysis that involves comparing marginal benefits and marginal costs.

**marginal benefit**
 - The additional benefit to a consumer from consuming one more unit of a good or service.

**opportunity cost**
 - The highest valued alternative that mast be given up to engage in an activity.

**trade-offs**
 - The idea that because of scarcity, producing more of one good or service means producing less of another good or service.

**Market economy**
 - An economy in which the decisions of households and firms interacting in markets allocate economic resources.

**allocative efficiency**
 - A state of the economy in which production is in accordance with consumer preferences in particular, every good or service is produced up to the point where the last unit provides a marginal benefit to society equal to the marginal cost of producing it.

**mixed economy**
 - An economy in which most economic decisions result from the interaction of buyers and sellers in markets but in which the government plays a significant role in the allocation of resources.

**productive efficiency**
 - A situation in which a good or service is produced at the lowest possible cost.

**voluntary exchange**

**microeconomics**
 - The study of how households and firms make choices, how they interact in markets, and how the government attempts to influence their choices.

**Entrepreneur**

If an entrepreneur is wrong about what consumers want or about the best way to produce goods and services, the entrepreneur’s funds can be lost.

**Revenue**
 - A firm's revenue is the total amount received for selling a good or service. It is calculated by multiplying the price per unit by the number of units sold.

**Profit**
 - A firm’s profit is the difference between its revenue and its costs. Economists distinguish between accounting profit and economic profit. In calculating accounting profit, we exclude the cost of some economic resources that the firm does not pay for explicitly. In calculating economic profit, we include the opportunity cost of all resources used by the firm. When we refer to profit in this book, we meaneconomic profit. It is important not to confuse profit with revenue.
